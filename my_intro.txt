Hello! I'm Shabbir Hussain, a software engineer with over seven years of experience building and scaling high-impact applications across the full stack. My passion lies in solving complex problems, from enhancing user engagement on platforms with millions of users to architecting cutting-edge solutions in the IoT and AI spaces.

### Driving Business Growth Through User-Centric Features

In my current role as an SDE-2 at Games24x7, I work on the My11Circle application, a platform serving over 10 million active users. My focus is on developing features that directly translate to business growth and user satisfaction. I recently spearheaded the "Winner Reactions" feature, an initiative that resulted in a 5% increase in revenue and a 7% boost in user engagement. I thrive on the technical challenges that come with a massive user base, having led a critical React Native framework upgrade that improved app stability and reduced build times by 20% and integrated advanced error monitoring that cut critical production crashes by 30%.

### Leadership in Technical Innovation & Platform Modernization

Before my current role, I led key modernization and development projects that set the foundation for business success. As a Lead Full Stack Engineer at Bondevalue, I orchestrated the end-to-end development of the BondBlox mobile trading app, successfully transitioning the platform to React Native to accelerate feature deployment. At Newgen Software, I led the development of a new Trade Finance platform from the ground up, architecting a secure backend with Java EE and Oracle to handle high-value international transactions.

### A Passion for Innovation: From IoT to AI

Beyond my core roles, I am passionate about exploring emerging technologies. I've developed several applications for the Internet of Things (IoT), creating controllers for Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) and Mesh networks that manage device binding, grouping, and real-time control. This passion for innovation recently led my team to win the AWS Agentic AI Hackathon, where I led the development of VerifAI, an AI-powered testing system. By leveraging Amazon Bedrock, we created a solution that reduced PR verification time by 83% and is projected to save over 50 developer hours monthly.

My goal is to continue leveraging my diverse skill set—spanning from native iOS and React Native to Node.js, Java, and AI—to build products that are not only technically excellent but also create a meaningful impact.

I'm always open to connecting and discussing new challenges in technology.
